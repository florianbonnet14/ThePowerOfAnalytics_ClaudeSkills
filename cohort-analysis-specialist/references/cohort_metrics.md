# Cohort Metrics Catalog

## Retention Metrics

### Classic Retention Rate
**Definition:** % of cohort active in a given period

**Formula:** Active Users(Cohort, Period) / Cohort Size × 100%

**Example:**
- Jan 2024 cohort: 1,000 users
- Active in M3 (April): 450 users
- M3 Retention = 45%

**Use for:** Overall retention tracking, cohort comparison

**Benchmarks (vary by industry):**
- M1: 40-70% (good)
- M3: 30-50% (good)
- M6: 20-40% (good)

### D1/D7/D30 Retention
**Definition:** % active on specific day after signup

**Why these matter:**
- **D1:** Measures immediate value ("Did they come back tomorrow?")
- **D7:** Measures habit formation ("Did they form a routine?")
- **D30:** Measures stickiness ("Did they stick around?")

**Good targets:**
- D1: >40% (consumer), >60% (B2B)
- D7: >30% (consumer), >50% (B2B)
- D30: >20% (consumer), >40% (B2B)

**Use for:** Product optimization, identifying where users drop off

### Rolling Retention
**Definition:** % active in period N OR ANY period after N

**Example:**
- User signs up Jan 1
- Active Jan 15 (M0)
- Inactive in Feb (M1)
- Active in March (M2)
- Rolling M1 retention = YES (active in M1 or later)

**Use for:** Understanding "dormant but not churned" users

### Return Retention
**Definition:** % who return in period N (can be inactive in between)

**Example:**
- User signs up Jan 1
- Inactive in Feb (M1)
- Active in March (M2)
- Return M2 retention = YES

**Use for:** Resurrection campaigns, understanding re-engagement

## Engagement Metrics

### Activity Frequency
**Definition:** How often cohort members are active

**Metrics:**
- % Active Days per Period
- Sessions per Active Day
- Average Time per Session

**Example:**
- Jan 2024 cohort in M3
- Active on 12 of 30 days = 40% active days
- 3 sessions per active day
- 15 minutes per session

**Use for:** Understanding depth of engagement

### Feature Adoption by Cohort
**Definition:** % of cohort that used specific feature

**Track:**
- Which features each cohort adopts
- Speed of adoption (days to first use)
- Ongoing usage vs. one-time trial

**Use for:** Feature success evaluation, onboarding optimization

### Engagement Score Evolution
**Definition:** Composite engagement metric tracked over time

**Example:**
- Engagement Score = (Sessions × 0.3) + (Features Used × 0.5) + (Days Active × 0.2)
- Track average score per cohort per period

**Use for:** Overall engagement health, predictive modeling

## Value Metrics

### Cohort Lifetime Value (LTV)
**Definition:** Total revenue generated by cohort over lifetime

**Formula:** 
```
Actual LTV = Total Revenue from Cohort / Cohort Size

Projected LTV = (Current ARPU × Projected Lifetime) / Discount Factor
```

**Components:**
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- Lifetime (months/years as customer)
- Gross Margin

**Use for:** CAC targets, channel evaluation, prioritization

### Cumulative Revenue by Period
**Definition:** Total revenue generated by cohort up to period N

**Example:**
```
Cohort   M0    M1    M2    M3    M4    M5
Jan 24   $50K  $80K  $95K  $105K $110K $113K
```

**Use for:** Understanding revenue trajectory, LTV projection

### Time to 80% LTV
**Definition:** How long until cohort generates 80% of projected LTV

**Example:**
- Projected LTV: $100
- Revenue by M6: $80
- Time to 80% LTV = 6 months

**Use for:** Payback period calculation, cash flow planning

### Revenue Retention
**Definition:** % of revenue retained from cohort

**Formula:** Revenue(Cohort, Period N) / Revenue(Cohort, Period 0) × 100%

**Note:** Can exceed 100% with expansion revenue

**Use for:** Net revenue retention, expansion tracking

## Predictive Metrics

### Leading Indicator Score
**Definition:** Early behaviors that predict long-term retention

**Process:**
1. Identify which Week 1 behaviors correlate with M6 retention
2. Create composite score
3. Track for new cohorts

**Example Indicators:**
- 3+ sessions in Week 1 → 75% M6 retention
- Invited teammate → 82% M6 retention
- Used Feature X → 68% M6 retention

**Use for:** Early warning system, proactive intervention

### Activation Rate by Cohort
**Definition:** % of cohort that completes activation milestone

**Track:**
- Activation rate per cohort
- Time to activation
- Correlation with retention

**Use for:** Onboarding optimization, retention prediction

### Quality Score Evolution
**Definition:** Cohort quality metric tracked over time

**Components:**
- Activation rate
- D7 retention
- Feature adoption
- Any early engagement metric

**Use for:** Acquisition channel evaluation, quality trends

## Comparison Metrics

### Cohort-to-Cohort Change
**Definition:** Period retention change between consecutive cohorts

**Formula:** Cohort(N) M1 - Cohort(N-1) M1

**Example:**
- Feb M1: 68%
- Jan M1: 65%
- Change: +3pp (percentage points)

**Use for:** Identifying inflection points, trend direction

### Best vs Worst Cohort Gap
**Definition:** Difference between best and worst performing cohort

**Formula:** Max(All Cohort Retentions) - Min(All Cohort Retentions)

**Example:**
- Best cohort M3: 55%
- Worst cohort M3: 42%
- Gap: 13pp

**Use for:** Understanding variance, identifying what changed

### Cohort Convergence
**Definition:** Do cohort retention curves converge or diverge over time?

**Measure:** Standard deviation of retention rates across cohorts by period

**Use for:** Understanding if product improvements are sustainable

## Health Metrics

### Retention Curve Shape Score
**Definition:** Quantifies "health" of retention curve

**Components:**
- Initial drop (M0→M1)
- Slope after M1
- Plateau level (if any)
- Time to plateau

**Classification:**
- Healthy: Quick plateau at acceptable level
- Concerning: Continuous decline, no plateau
- Critical: Steep continuous decline

**Use for:** Executive summary, health monitoring

### Early Warning Signal
**Definition:** Leading indicators that recent cohorts underperforming

**Triggers:**
- D7 retention drops >5pp from trend
- M1 retention below historical average
- Activation rate declining 2+ cohorts in a row

**Use for:** Proactive issue detection

### Resurrection Rate
**Definition:** % of churned users who return

**Formula:** Churned Users Who Returned / Total Churned × 100%

**Benchmark:** 10-20% resurrection is common

**Use for:** Win-back campaign potential, product stickiness

## Segmented Cohort Metrics

### Cohort × Segment Retention
**Definition:** Retention broken down by both cohort and segment

**Example:**
```
         M1 Retention
         Enterprise  SMB
Jan 24   78%        65%
Feb 24   80%        68%
```

**Use for:** Understanding which segments improve/decline

### Cohort × Channel Quality
**Definition:** Retention by acquisition channel within cohort

**Use for:** Channel quality over time, CAC optimization

### Cohort × Feature Usage
**Definition:** Retention by feature adoption within cohort

**Use for:** Feature impact, onboarding focus

## Calculation Tips

**Handling Edge Cases:**
- Users who sign up on last day of month → Include in that month's cohort
- Users with no activity → Mark as inactive, not missing data
- Test/internal users → Exclude from analysis
- Users who delete account → Include as churned

**Statistical Significance:**
- Small cohorts (<100 users) → Wide confidence intervals
- Use statistical tests when comparing cohorts
- Report confidence levels for predictions

**Data Freshness:**
- Mark incomplete periods clearly
- Wait for period to complete before comparing
- Use projections for most recent cohorts
