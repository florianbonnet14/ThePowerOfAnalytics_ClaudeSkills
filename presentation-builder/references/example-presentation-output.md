SLIDE 1: Cover Slide

Title: Mobile App Conversion Rate Drop: Root Cause & Recovery Plan
Date: October 15, 2024
Analyst: Sarah Chen

---

SLIDE 2: Executive Summary

MOTIVE:
• Mobile app conversion rate dropped from 24% to 16% in Q3 2024 (8pp decline)

Supporting points:
• Represents $2.4M in lost quarterly revenue
• Sudden drop beginning mid-August, persisting through September
• Critical to address for Q4 revenue targets

ANSWER:
• Root cause: New onboarding flow (launched Aug 15) requires phone verification before browsing

Supporting points:
• Creates "wall" effect causing 45% of new users to abandon during onboarding
• Users who complete are 20% less likely to make first purchase
• Issue isolated to mobile app; desktop and mobile web unaffected

IMPACT:
• $2.4M lost in Q3; $3.2M projected loss in Q4 if unresolved

Supporting points:
• 180K fewer new accounts created vs. target
• 15% lower 30-day retention for recent cohorts
• App store rating dropped from 4.7 to 4.3

NEXT-STEPS:
• Roll back to previous onboarding flow → Engineering team → Oct 18

Supporting points:
• Conduct user research on verification preferences → UX Research → Oct 25
• Redesign onboarding with optional verification → Product team → Nov 15
• Implement A/B testing framework → Data team → Nov 30

SLIDE 7: Text Slide

Action Title: Conversion Decline is Isolated to New Users, Not Platform-Wide Issue

Bullet points:
• New users (<7 days) dropped from 24% to 16% (-8pp)
• Returning users (7+ days) maintained at 44-45% (no change)
• Issue specific to new user experience, not broader product problem
• Core product remains strong for engaged users

Action Title: Users Who Complete New Onboarding Still Convert 25% Less Than Previous Cohorts

Bullet points:
• July cohort (old flow): 28% first-purchase conversion
• August-September cohorts (new flow): 21-22% conversion
• Even "successful" users show reduced engagement and trust

Action Title: Impact is Consistent Across All Geographies and Device Types

Bullet points:
• US: -8pp, Europe: -7pp, Asia: -9pp conversion decline
