The Presentation Builder helps take a detailed analysis and synthetize it into a list of slides, each with detailed content for you to present your findings to your audience (stakeholders, leadership ...).
It builds upon the 3rd part of my book "The Power of Analytics" and I encourage you go there in order to learn more about how to build impact presentation.
#### Important note #1:
This skill was buitl assuming you have an analysis file, ideally generated by the `analyis-results-collector`.

### Important note #2:
This skill does not build a PPT or Google Slides.
It gives you a list of slides to be built and for each the title, format, content and exact copy.
The reason why I did not build a fully fledged slide builder is because every company has their own templates, color does, fonts (often not free) and it is impossible to build a simple skill that would buidl slides according to your company standards.
So I did the ehavy lifting by building a skill that literally gives you a files where you just need to copy the content and paste it in your slide template.

# Getting Started
Launch it using the command `/presentation-builder`.

You will be asked if you have an analysis file (which you have if you used the `analysis-results-collector` before) and an executvie summary.
For the executive summary:
* Claude will use my `executive-summary-writer` skill to build one if you do not have suing the MAIN framework
* If you used the `executive-summary-writer` yourself before launching the `presentation-builder` then use the file it produced.

Importantly, you will need to precise the audience for this presentation as the tone, workding, and length will be adjusted accordingly.

Once you mentionned what you have and do not have you will provide the files path.
