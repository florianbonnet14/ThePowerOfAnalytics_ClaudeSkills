# Analysis Plan Template

Use this template to create a comprehensive analysis plan.

## Analysis Plan: [Question]

### Executive Summary
**Problem Statement:** [What changed or what are we investigating]
**Primary Question:** [Specific question to answer]
**Decision to be Made:** [What will stakeholders decide based on this]
**Timeline:** [Expected duration]
**Expected Deliverable:** [What will be produced]

### Success Criteria
**A successful analysis will:**
1. [Specific outcome 1]
2. [Specific outcome 2]
3. [Specific outcome 3]

**We'll know we're done when:**
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

**The answer will enable us to:**
- [Decision/action that will be taken]

### Context
**Metric Definition:** [What metric are we analyzing]
**KPI Tree:** [How it breaks down]
**Recent Changes:** [What happened recently that might be relevant]

### Hypotheses (Prioritized)

#### TIER 1 - Highest Priority

**H1: [Hypothesis Statement]**
- **Driver:** [Which KPI/metric is affected]
- **Hypothesis:** [What we think happened]
- **Expected Contribution:** [How much of the change this might explain]
- **Priority Score:** [X/10] (Probability × Impact × Actionability)

**Analysis Approach:**

*Data to Collect:*
- [Data point 1 with granularity]
- [Data point 2 with segmentation]
- [Data point 3 with time window]

*How to Analyze:*

Analysis 1: [Name]
- **Chart type:** [Line chart / Bar chart / Table / etc.]
- **X-axis:** [What variable]
- **Y-axis:** [What metric]
- **Lines/Bars to plot:** [What to show]
- **Comparison:** [What to compare against]

Analysis 2: [Name]
- **Chart type:** [Type]
- **Structure:** [How to organize]
- **Key elements:** [What to include]

*What to Look For:*

To VALIDATE:
- [Pattern 1 that would confirm hypothesis]
- [Pattern 2 that would confirm hypothesis]

To INVALIDATE:
- [Pattern 1 that would disprove hypothesis]
- [Pattern 2 that would disprove hypothesis]

*Proposed Deep-Dives if Validated:*
1. [Deep-dive 1 description]
2. [Deep-dive 2 description]

---

**H2: [Next Hypothesis]**
[Same structure as H1]

#### TIER 2 - Medium Priority
[Additional hypotheses with same structure]

#### TIER 3 - Lower Priority
[Additional hypotheses with same structure]

### Analysis Strategy
[Overall approach - which order to test hypotheses, decision points between them]

### Success Metrics for This Analysis
- [ ] [Success metric 1]
- [ ] [Success metric 2]
- [ ] [Success metric 3]

### Recommendations Template (To be filled post-analysis)

**Recommendation 1: [Title]**
- **Problem:** [What's broken]
- **Root Cause:** [Why it's broken]
- **Proposed Fix:** [What to do]
- **Expected Impact:** [Quantified improvement]
- **Effort:** [Estimated effort]
- **Timeline:** [When implementable]
- **Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
- **Owner:** [Who will do it]
