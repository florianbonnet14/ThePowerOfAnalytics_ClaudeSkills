The Executive Summary Writer is an expert at taking a full analysis and build an executive summary slide/introduction.
To learn more about Executive summaries and the MAIN framework used by this skill, refer to the dedicated Chapter in my book The Power of Analytics.

# Getting Started

To launch the skill use the `executive-summary-writer` command.
After that you will be prompted to give an analysis file, which you should have if you used the `analysis-results-collector` skill before.

Claude will ask clarifying questions like the Audience type and owners for the next steps section!

After that it will generate the executive summary immediately

You can of course adjust the output to your desire

And once you are satisfied, ask Claude to save your executive summary in a markdown file.

# Next Steps
After that you can use the `presentation-builder` skill to build the presentation that goes with this executive summary.
