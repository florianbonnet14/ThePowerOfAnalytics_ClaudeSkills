The influential factor detective is here to help you thoroughly find which are the elements of your operations and custoemr experience that can influence a certain KPI.
An easy example is the Subject Line of an email that will influence the Open Rate of that email.
To know more about Influential Factors, I recommend you to read the dedicated chapter of my book The Power of Analytics.

# Getting Started
To get started, open Claude Code and type the `/influential-factors-detective` command. 
the Detective will ask you questions abou the KPI you want to focus on. 
If you have a KPI Tree markdown file built with the KPI Tree Architect, you can refer to it directly.

# Zeroing in on Influential Factors
In the example below, the Detective will use the context of the work done previously in defining the KPI Tree to ask further questions.

In this example we converge very fast and the Detective is ready to give us a full list of Factors as well as prioritization on which to focus on first to impact the KPI's value.
