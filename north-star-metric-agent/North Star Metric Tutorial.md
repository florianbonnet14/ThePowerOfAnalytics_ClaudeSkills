The North Star metric agent is here to help you find the North Star Metric of your company or your team.
To learn everything about North Star metrics, why they are crucial, and how to use them I recommend you
to read Chapter 2 of my book "The Power of Analytics" (available on Amazon - paperback and Kindle)

In this tutorial, we play the role of the PM in charge of the Onboarding team at Buildr, a fictional Lovable competitor. 

# Launch
To launch the skill use the /north-star-metric-agent command in Claude Code. 
The agent will start asking you questions about your company and/or team in order to guide in finding the right North Star Metric.

# Converging on a North Star Metric

You just need to converse with the agent to give him the details it needs to help. 
In this example we just need to answer couple of questions due to the simplicty of our perimeter.

When the agent is ready it will make you proposals. You can accept one or just challenge it until you are satisfied

In this example we merged two proposal to fit what we believe is a good North Star Metric for the team.
